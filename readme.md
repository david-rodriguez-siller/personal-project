# Personal Project
### Project Objectives
 - Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook Final Report.

 - Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make your process repeateable and your report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

 - Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of home value. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

 - Construct a model to predict assessed home value for single family properties using regression techniques.

 - Make recommendations to a data science team about how to improve predictions.
